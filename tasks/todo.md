1. new tools
  1. ✅ functions without tests
  2. ✅ classes without tests
  3. ✅ full relationships between two functions, if one call will eventually lead to the other
2. Add contstant to DB
  1. ✅ detect constants in the code
  2. ✅ add constants to DB
  3. ✅ add tool to find repetitive constants in the code
3. Sizes
  1. add the length of the class to the class node
  2. ✅ add the length of the function to the function node
4. ✅ remove the print statements while scanning, if possible use tqdm
5. ✅ update the README.md with the needed information about copying example.env to .env and changing the PROJECT_DIR to the path of the project you want to scan
6. ✅ Investigate if the file are being registered too. and mapped to the correct classes and functions
7. ✅ need a tool to find constants with same name regardless of their value
8. ✅ research how codescan_mcp_server.py can be splitted into multiple files in a subfolder. create a file per tool if it is economically viable
9. ✅ Implement a tool to find functions relations by functions full name, it must have an option to search by partial name
10. ✅ Implement a tool to find classes relations by classes full name, it must have an option to search by partial name
