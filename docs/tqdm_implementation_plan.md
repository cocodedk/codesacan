# tqdm Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for replacing the print statements during the scanning process with tqdm progress bars. This will provide a cleaner, more informative output during scanning while reducing verbosity.

## Current State
Currently, the code scanning process produces verbose output with print statements for:
- Each file being analyzed
- Each class, function, and constant found
- Each function call detected
- Imports in test files

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Main Scanner Progress
- Add a tqdm progress bar in `scanner.py` to show overall progress
- Display the total number of Python files to be scanned
- Update the progress as each file is processed

### 2. File Analysis Progress
- Replace the verbose print statements in `analysis.py` with tqdm
- Show progress for each file being analyzed
- Include counters for different types of elements found (classes, functions, etc.)

### 3. Analyzer Modifications
- Add a logging system to `analyzer.py` that collects statistics instead of printing
- Reduce verbosity by only printing summaries
- Use tqdm to display progress for large operations

### 4. Quiet Mode
- Add a `--quiet` flag to suppress most output
- Add a `--verbose` flag to retain detailed logging for debugging

## Files to Modify
1. `scanner.py` - Add tqdm progress bar for overall scanning
2. `analysis.py` - Replace file analysis prints with tqdm
3. `analyzer.py` - Replace verbose prints with statistics collection
4. `db_operations.py` - Clean up database operation messages

## Implementation Details

### Progress Bar Design
- Main progress: File scanning (x/total files)
- Sub-progress: Elements found (classes, functions, constants)
- Final summary: Total elements found and timing information

### Statistics Collection
Instead of printing each element as it's found, collect statistics:
- Number of classes
- Number of functions
- Number of constants
- Number of function calls
- etc.

Display these statistics in a summary at the end of the scanning process.
