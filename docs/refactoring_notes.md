# Refactoring of scanner.py

## Overview

The `scanner.py` script was refactored to improve maintainability by breaking down the monolithic file into smaller, more focused modules within a `codescan_lib` package. This follows the single responsibility principle and makes the codebase easier to maintain and extend.

## Structure

The refactored codebase has the following structure:

```
codescan/
├── codescan_lib/
│   ├── __init__.py       # Package initialization and exports
│   ├── constants.py      # Configuration and constants
│   ├── utils.py          # Helper functions
│   ├── analyzer.py       # CodeAnalyzer class for AST analysis
│   ├── db_operations.py  # Database operations
│   └── analysis.py       # Analysis functions
└── scanner.py            # Main script (now much slimmer)
```

## Module Responsibilities

### codescan_lib/constants.py
- Contains all configuration variables and constants
- Handles loading of environment variables via dotenv
- Defines database connection parameters
- Defines test detection patterns

### codescan_lib/utils.py
- Contains helper functions for file path handling and detection
- Functions: is_stdlib_module, is_example_file, is_test_file, is_project_file, get_relative_path

### codescan_lib/analyzer.py
- Contains the CodeAnalyzer class for AST analysis
- Handles parsing of Python code
- Creates graph database nodes and relationships

### codescan_lib/db_operations.py
- Contains functions for database operations
- Functions: clear_database, get_db_session, close_db_connection, print_db_info

### codescan_lib/analysis.py
- Contains high-level analysis functions
- Functions: analyze_file, analyze_directory

### codescan_lib/__init__.py
- Makes the directory a proper Python package
- Exports the public API
- Centralizes imports to avoid circular dependencies

### scanner.py
- Main script that processes command-line arguments
- Uses the refactored modules to perform the analysis

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**: Each module has a clear responsibility
2. **Better Readability**: Smaller files are easier to read and understand
3. **Easier Testing**: Functions and classes with clear boundaries are easier to test
4. **Simplified Extensibility**: New features can be added without modifying existing code
5. **Better Organization**: Code is organized by function rather than being monolithic
